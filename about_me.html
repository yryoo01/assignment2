    <h2>My Memorable Trip</h2>
    <p>In 2022, my family and I drove all the way from Rhode Island to California. We stopped by many destinations to travel, including New York, Washington D.C., the Grand Canyon, and Las Vegas. Not only was it fun to stop by all the fun places, but it was also nice to see scenery that we have never seen before during the drive. The entire trip lasted for 2 weeks and was one of the most memorable times in my life. We only drove so far because we were moving, but it was more of a fun traveling experience than a long and boring drive.</p>
    
    <h2>My Favorite Pet Names</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dian</strong> - A cat named Dian. Dian is my old cat that I have faint memories of but she was adorable.</li>
        <li><strong>Yang</strong> - A cat named Yang. Yang is one of my current cats. She is shy and afraid of a lot of things but she likes it when I pat her.</li>
        <li><strong>Celtics</strong> - A dog named Celtics. I have always wanted a dog as a child but never got to have one.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.theinterstellarbbq.com/" target="_blank">The Interstellar BBQ</a> - This restaurant is my favorite because they have very unique flavoring for the BBQ and the meat is very tender and juicy. It was the best Texan BBQ I've ever had. It's a little pricy and out of the way, but if I got an opportunity to have it again I would be super excited.</p>
    
    <h2>My Favorite Food</h2>
    <img src="/galbi.jpg" alt="Galbi - Korean beef short ribs">
    <p>This is a Korean dish made of beef short ribs. It's marinated with sweet and savory sauce and you typically use your hand to grab the bone part and eat the meat. It's normally prepared on special days like national holidays and birthdays.</p>
